      <h1>Best laptop for programming in 2021</h1>
      <p>
        When it comes to the best laptop for programming, it's not just mobility
        you need. Storage, speed, and a comfortable keyboard are more vital than
        clock speeds, cores, and threads. It’s true that you’ll need one of the
        best processors for the best programming and coding laptop, but a speedy
        machine also means speedy memory and storage, like one of the best SSDs.
        After all, when you're working the last thing you want are any potential
        bottlenecks. And, a swift laptop will save time when loading and running
        your projects. That not only means time saved but a streamlined
        workflow. Also, they might not be the first things that come to mind but
        make sure the laptop has a great screen and comes with the best keyboard
        you can find. You don’t want the display to strain your eyes after hours
        of use. And, you don’t want to deal with an uncomfortable keyboard when
        you’ve been typing for long periods of time. Don’t worry if that sounds
        like a lot to keep track of. We’ve collected our favorites for the best
        laptop for programming to help you get the right one for you, some of
        them not that much more expensive than the best laptops under $500.
        Whether you’re looking for a Windows 10 machine, a macOS, or even some
        of the best Chromebooks, we’ve got you covered.

          The Google's Pixelbook Go is the best Chromebook money can buy right
          now, and it's also a fantastic laptop for programming. Coming with a
          more affordable price tag than its predecessor, the Pixelbook,
          Google's latest Chromebook still packs plenty of the premium features
          the original came with, including an amazing battery life, and one of
          the best keyboards we've used on a laptop - an important consideration
          when looking for a laptop for programming in. Sure, it doesn't use
          Windows 10 - instead it runs Chrome OS - but for most programmers,
          especially web developers, this won't be an issue. You can also
          install Linux on this thing as well, which makes it an even more
          versatile laptop for programming. It features some impressive specs
          for a Chromebook, which ensures that Chrome OS positively flies on
          this device, and puts its performance on par with many of the more
          expensive Windows laptops and MacBooks.

          The MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) may not have gotten a massive
          design overhaul, but what it lacks in that department, it makes up for
          big time in performance and battery life thanks to Apple’s
          groundbreaking M1 chip. This MacBook Pro has the longest battery life
          in a MacBook, in fact, allowing you to use it for programming for
          hours on end without having to worry about stopping to find a charger.
          The M1 chip is no slouch when it comes to performance, either, so
          compiling and testing code is extremely quick as well. If you have the
          budget for it, this is a programming laptop that will last you for
          years.
