          A cryptocurrency exchange, or a digital currency exchange (DCE), is a
          business that allows customers to trade cryptocurrencies or digital
          currencies for other assets, such as conventional fiat money or other
          digital currencies. Exchanges may accept credit card payments, wire
          transfers or other forms of payment in exchange for digital currencies
          or cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency exchange can be a market maker
          that typically takes the bid–ask spreads as a transaction commission
          for is service or, as a matching platform, simply charges fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some brokerages which also focus on other assets such as stocks, like
          Robinhood and eToro, let users purchase but not withdraw
          cryptocurrencies to cryptocurrency wallets. Dedicated cryptocurrency
          exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase do allow cryptocurrency
          withdrawals, however.
        </li>
        <li>
          The creators of digital currencies are often independent of the
          digital currency exchange that facilitate trading in the currency. In
          one type of system, digital currency providers (DCP) are businesses
          that keep and administer accounts for their customers, but generally
          do not issue digital currency to those customers directly. Customers
          buy or sell digital currency from digital currency exchanges, who
          transfer the digital currency into or out of the customer's DCP
          account. Some exchanges are subsidiaries of DCP, but many are legally
          independent businesses. The denomination of funds kept in DCP accounts
          may be of a real or fictitious currency.

        <h5>1. Be Cautious</h5>
        <li>
          The first thing to keep in mind when searching for digital currency
          exchanges—and when considering any aspect of cryptocurrency
          investing—is that scams and fraud are out there, and they can have a
          very real impact on individual investors. Mt. Gox, one of the earliest
          digital currency exchanges and once one of the most popular,
          collapsed. Others have been hacked or otherwise compromised.
        </li>
        <h5>2. Go With Higher Security</h5>
        <li>
          The harder it is to create an account at a particular exchange, the
          better. If it's too easy to generate an account, that suggests that an
          exchange is not particularly trustworthy. What happens, then, if your
          digital assets suddenly disappear? You may have a much more difficult
          time tracking down and retrieving your money in those cases.
        </li>

        <h5>Why Should Someone Consider Using a Cryptocurrency Exchange?</h5>
        <li>
          Crypto exchanges work similarly to a broker, giving you the tools to
          buy and sell cryptocurrencies easily. They also offer security
          features and storage options for your digital assets that may be
          superior to maintaining wallet software on your own. Cryptocurrency
          exchanges have started offering custodial key storage for their users
          but you should use this service cautiously, as cryptocurrency
          exchanges are often prized targets for cybercriminals.
        </li>
        <h5>How Can You Be Sure a Cryptocurrency Exchange Is Legitimate?</h5>
        <li>
          First, look for the physical address associated with the exchange. If
          there is no address readily available, you should not use the
          exchange. There are many reasons for this. Transparency is often a
          sign of legitimacy.
