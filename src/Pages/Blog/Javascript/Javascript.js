          Something is loading. While you may not be actively aware of it,
          JavaScript is used in nearly every website on the internet these days.
          It's a programming language that is simple to learn and incredibly
          versatile. What is JavaScript? JavaScript is a text-based,
          object-oriented programming language used to make webpages and apps
          more dynamic and interactive for visitors. Used on both the client and
          server side, JavaScript offers enhanced abilities that basic languages
          like HTML and CSS can't, such as refreshing a Twitter feed, embedded
          YouTube videos, and more. In other words, JavaScript-enhanced webpages
          are more dynamic and user-focused, which can keep users coming back to
          the site. Both developers and website visitors benefit from
          Javascript. Maskot/Getty Images That said, JavaScript is meant to be
          used with other programming languages rather than as a replacement for
          them. For instance, websites and apps will still need to use HTML for
          basic structure, while CSS is required for formatting and layout
          preferences as well as controlling how the text, images, and other
          content on a webpage is presented. From there, JavaScript can enhance
          those elements, taking them from being static features to interactive
          and exciting ones.

        <h5>What JavaScript is used for</h5>
        <li>
          Javascript allows webpages to become more interactive in many ways
          including displaying animations, making functional drop-down menus,
          zooming in and out of webpage images, or even changing button colors
          when the user's mouse hovers over it.{" "}
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript is widely used in game development, particularly for new
          developers who want to practice and refine their skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some developers also choose to use Node.js, a back-end JavaScript
          infrastructure, to create basic web servers and to build on a site's
          infrastructure.{" "}

        <h5>The advantages of using Javascript</h5>
        <li>
          Interactivity: JavaScript websites are more interactive and appealing
          to users since the language creates richer and more attractive
          interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Speed: Websites will load and operate at higher speed since JavaScript
          can be run immediately in the browser, thereby reducing demand on the
          server.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ease: It's simple to implement and often takes only a basic level of
          knowledge to utilize.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integration: JavaScript works well with most other programming
          languages, making it possible to integrate into a host of different
          applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Popularity: It's incredibly popular â€” most websites use JavaScript in
          some form regardless of the nature of the website.{" "}
