        MDBootstrap: 70% of web developers support social benefits to ease AI
        transformation

        Exactly 70% agreed that governments should consider introducing social
        benefit policies, like social aids, health and shelter benefits, and
        universal basic income, in order to ease the burden of industry
        transformation and avoid the unemployment crisis related to AI
        advancement, according to a new report form MDBootrap. Recent
        advancements in AI tools, led by the announcement of GitHub Copilot,
        cause concern about unemployment.

        Most developers recognize the danger that AI poses for web development
        jobs. Most of them agreed that AI transformation is likely to be a cause
        of widespread unemployment in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        When asked if they personally think that AI may eventually take their
        own job and limit their future web development possibilities, a
        staggering majority of 66.8% disagreed. This is a clear symptom of the
        optimism bias — only 21.7% of respondents expressed any fear about their
        own jobs, while most of them predicted that other developers will lose
        theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though web developers recognize AI as a danger, they still plan to
        accelerate the growth of AI-powered tools. 65.5% said that they plan to
        use GitHub Copilot in their work. <br /> Surprisingly, even though
        they’re against government meddling in the matters of IT industry and
        introducing regulations, most developers proved to be in support of
        government aid. <br />
        MDBootstrap explored what web developers think about the prospect of AI
        replacing them. It surveyed 500+ web developers to find out more about
        their thoughts on the GitHub Copilot launch, AI risks to the job market,
        and possible solutions. <br />
